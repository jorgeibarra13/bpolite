- [NOT STARTED] consider other types of elements that could be editable and expand on it

- [DONE] The popup.js file is probably not needed anymore. Maybe we should delete it

- [DONE] Put this in a server somewhere, and expose an API. (serverless)
  - [DONE] create an api that does the calls instead
  - [DONE] make the extension call that API instead
