DONEs
- [DONE] changed: block context menu while request is being processed
- [BUGFIX] transform text only works once
- [DONE] make the api handle the secret through a key vault or some other secure secret storage
- [DONE] The popup.js file is probably not needed anymore. Maybe we should delete it
- [CHANGED] Display the processed message in a textbox. ie I type in a mail a body, select, right click and it shows a suggestion after the text, if I click enter on my keyboard it swaps the current text with the processed one.
- [DONE] Put this in a server somewhere, and expose an API. (serverless)
  - [DONE] create an api that does the calls instead
  - [DONE] make the extension call that API instead
- [DONE] Limits the UI to only make the calls when a valid editable text is selected
